# Meteor Streams [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arunoda/meteor-streams.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arunoda/meteor-streams)

DB less realtime communication for meteor

## Development Status

CAVEAT EMPTOR: This version (fgm:streams) is a fork of arunoda:streams to allow continued use of streams in Meteor 1.2.1 while converting to an other mechanism : it allows streams users to evolve their other code to Meteor 1.2.1, and hopefully 1.3 while converting to another mechanism instead of having to remain on pre-0.9. Do not expect it to live long: just use it as a temporary crutch.

Project development status is [inactive](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-streams/issues/21#issuecomment-59030380).
